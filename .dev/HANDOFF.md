# HANDOFF — 2026-08-05

**In flight:** `.dev/` convention adopted; `.planning/` frozen. First workflow-driven work is the
eval foundation (`.dev/plans/260805-eval-foundation.md`).

**Branch:** work happens on `feat/eval-foundation` off `main`. `main` was clean at `d72c519`.

---

## Where the product actually is

**Milestone v1.2 (Gotham console + agent management) is NOT closeable.** Phases 20, 21, 23 all
executed; the 2026-08-04 audit (`.planning/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`) returned `gaps_found` — 27/29
requirements satisfied, 4/5 integration flows wired. Phase 23 closed the ops-room wiring seam
(11/11 gate) and `3701b05` closed the console half of the deploy-gate contradiction.

**Two things block the milestone:**

1. **OPS-15 — server-side gap.** `POST /approve-deployment` (`deployment.py:348+`) gates on the
   frozen `run.recommendation` and never consults live `open_findings`. A critical finding raised
   after a clean checklist run is still accepted **by the API**; the console can no longer be used to
   do it, but any script or curl can. Fails closed, so not a security hole. Backend change with its
   own threat surface — needs a plan.
2. **`REQUIREMENTS.md` traceability.** `WIRE-01..05` has **zero rows** (grep-confirmed). The v1.2
   rollup sentence is stale. The `OPS-01..06` collision is live: lines 274-279 hold them as Phase 10
   / M10 `Pending`, while line 415's `OPS-01..16 | Phase 21 | ✓ Complete` falsely ticks the weekly
   cron, digest email and alerting that Phase 21 never built.

**Open but not blocking:** Nyquist `status: draft` on `20/21/23-VALIDATION.md`; Phase 20 has no
`20-SECURITY.md`; the `eval/page.tsx` unguarded-read twin (`res.scores.faithfulness`, 5 call sites).

## The live-gate backlog — one root cause

`VER-01`, `AUD-03`, `CAP-03`, the 6 blocked UAT items in `23-UAT.md`, and the 4 `human_needed` items
in `23-VERIFICATION.md` all share one precondition: **there is no PostgreSQL server on this
machine.** Stale `postgresql-x64-17` service pointing at a deleted binary; nothing on 5432-5435.
`CONTROL_DB_URL` is live Neon production and is never a substitute. No v1.2 migration has been
applied to a live Neon DB.

Installing a local PostgreSQL clears all of it with no planning or code work.

## What this session found (the reason the plan exists)

Full detail in `.dev/reference/measurement-layer-audit.md`. Seven defects in the measurement layer:

- **D1** the RAG eval never invokes the agent — the label is used as the prediction (`eval.py:200`)
- **D2** every eval result is written to a Neon branch that is deleted in `finally` (`eval.py:281-313`)
- **D3** the deploy gate's eval query uses columns that do not exist → fails **open**
  (`deployment_service.py:201`)
- **D4** 5 of 7 red-team attackers were never given their tools → report clean
  (`red_team_service.py:179/197` defined, never referenced)
- **D5** filing a *failing* trace stores its answer as ground truth (`bench.py:147`)
- **D6** mined scenarios are inert by construction (`reference_answer=''` vs `WHERE != ''`)
- **D7** every LLM judge is uncalibrated; the harness exists with zero labels entered

**Hard ordering constraint:** D2 currently masks D5. Fixing the write-back without fixing the label
inversion in the same change activates a path that serves a human-flagged failure to customers via
`verified_qa_lookup`.

## Toolchain state

- `apps/api/.venv` exists but is a **shell** — 34 packages, no pytest. Restore:
  `cd apps/api && uv sync --extra dev`. (A restore was in progress at handoff; two concurrent `uv`
  runs deadlock on the wheel cache lock — run one at a time.)
- `apps/admin/node_modules` and `apps/widget/node_modules` are present.
- Backend suite baseline **OBSERVED 2026-08-05 at `fd8fa20`: 1199 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failed,
  33 warnings, 202s.** Matches the figure `23-09` recorded from its executor's output. Any phase
  claiming a delta measures against this.

## Next move

1. Finish the toolchain restore, observe the real baseline.
2. Run `.dev/workflows/eval-foundation.workflow.js` on `feat/eval-foundation`.
3. Step 0 of the ladder is **owner work, not agent work**: score
   `apps/api/tests/evals/calibration/human_scores.csv`. Nothing above it can be trusted until judges
   are calibrated. The workflow prepares the inputs; it cannot supply the judgement.
